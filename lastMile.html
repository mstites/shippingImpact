      <div>
        <h2> Impacts </h2>
        <p>Some stats</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2> Methods </h2>
        There are a number of methods for handling the most complicated stage of the shipping process, last mile delivery. Each of them have their own pros and cons, but often customer convenience and second delievery attempt methods are valued over more economocial and less environmentally impactful options. Choosing the right approach is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, factor in reducing the environmental impact and carbon footprint of shipping. Small trucks, vans, or cars with few packages are significantly less carbon efficient than big trucks (or especially trains) with many packages.ALL BASED FROM SOURCE #1.
        <div>
          <p class=bold>PLAN TO ADD CHART OF THE METHODS AND THEIR ATTRIBUTES</p>
          <h3>Attended Home Delivery</h3>
          <p>Delivery to the home with a costumer signature. This method leads to lots of failed delivery, the source of most green house gas emissions involved in last-mile delivery. This can be minimized by scheduling ahead, but this makes shipping routing complicated and often inefficient.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Unattended Home Delivery</h3>
          <p> Delivery to the home irregardless of signature. Much more efficient than attended home delivery due to the lack of delivery windows but still requires going to home. The high risk of stolen packages leads not only to frustrated customres and lost revanue, but also an environmental impact as those lost packages have to be replaced - essentially doubling the environmental impact of the product, packaging, shipping, etc. Returns are also a big draw back here, as with any residential address drop off, as routes often have to be diverted - out of the way - to pick up returns </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Reception Box</h3>
          <p> A box to drop off packages where the customer can pick up the package when they are available. There are two variants: </p>
          <h4>Own Reception Box</h4>
          <p>The box is at the customer's location. This requires inefficient delivery with lots of stops, but avoids issues of needing to make a second delivery attempt - as the package can be left regardless if a person is home or not.</p>
          <h4>Delivery Box</h4>
          <p>An insulated and secured box to deliver to at some specified location.The location can be chosen using different methods but is usually chosen to optimize some of the inefficiency issues of the own reception box method while still remaining relatively close to the customer. However, because it may not be at a protected residential or commercial address, there is a risk of the box or the items inside being stolen if not secured properly.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Collection Point (CDP)</h3>
          <p>A point where the package recipient can pick up packages. These are more efficient and environmentally conscious than individual reception boxes or home delievery, as the consumer is responsible almost in part for part of that last mile journey - the delivery service only has to get it close not on the door. However, depending on the distribution of people, there can still be a lot of locations required. There are two common variants: locker point and service point.</p>
          <h4>Locker Point</h4>
          <p>A shared reception box installed at a public area. Requires building the point, which can be environmentally and economically costly as there is a lot of security that has to go into a well engineered Locker Point.</p>
          <h4>Service Point</h4>
          <p>Provides the same function as a locker point, but exists in an already existing location such as schools, local stores, hospitals, etc. This significantly reduces the environmental impact compared to locker points, and drastically compared to delivery boxes.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Post Office</h3>
          <p> A post office can be set a set delivery cases. However, they are mostly used now as a destination for failed first-time delivery. Delivering to the post office helps to minimize last mile delivery cost in multiple factors as people can: pay, collect, and most importantly return items. Thus, if a return is needed, it can be sent out from the same location. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
      <h2>Looking forward</h2>
      <p>The two most common methods currently are both home delivery methods: attended home delivery and unattended home delivery (described above). These also happen to be some of the most impactful methods, especially attended home delivery. When combined with return shipping which can be done from home, this becomes doubly impactful. There has been some recent moves by Amazon to motivate constumers to drop off at a centralized point, such as the USPS or an Amazon Locker, for returns. However, this seems to be more motivated by profits than by environmental impact reasons.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, placing more impact on environmental impact when considering last mile shipping options is a key step in reducing (and reaching net zero) environmental impact. Right now, the culture created by companies and reinstated from consummers values cost savings and convenience above long term impacts to our environment. There are certainly things that can be done as individuals to pressure corporations. But once again, the point of this piece is to encourage those with the power - not individuals as part of the system - to pressure the organizations they are a part of to make ecological impact a part of their key values. Last mile shipping could be a good place to start, as there are also key cost saving benefits that often align with the environmental benefits (reduce number of delivery points, more local delivery, less returns, more efficient routes)</p>
