      <h1> Project Overview</h1>
      <p> This website discusses and serves as a compilation of research around the environmental impact of shipping. I looked in three key areas: packaging materials, last mile delivery, and Amazon. Combined, my goal was to use these areas to paint the effects of the consumerist culture within the shipping industry. I want to encourage the people encouraging this content to analyze the culture we exist in as a society, and are continually building, and how that does or does not consider our impact on the environment.</p>
      <h2> Topic Explanation </h2>
      <p>I chose the first topic, packaging materials, because I think it is commonly misunderstood. This is in part due to all the media around packaging materials, mainly companies pitching how environmental friendly their materials are even though this is not usually the reality. This area of the industry has also changed a lot in recent years due to China no longer accepting most recycling imports</p>
      <p>Last mile delivery is the most complicated part of the delivery process. One thing that really stuck out in my research is how minimizing enviromental impact often co-insided with a cost savings measure; as efficiency in route planning saves both gas and reduces emissions. However, still those measures were not taken. This page discusses that in more detail.</p>
      <p>One of the key reasons I wanted to do this project was because of the recent rise of Amazon. They have changed so many norms around what our society expects in regards to e-commerce and commerce in general. I have only been alive for 20 years, and  yet I have seen such a shift in attitudes. I think they serve as a perfect illustration of how quick expectations and culture can change, and not always for the good. </p>

      <h2> Audience </h2>
      <p>I think our culture tries to put too much responsibility on to individuals to fix things instead of the corporations and capitalistic entities that caused the problem in the first place. I want to shift that window a bit and help answer the question: how can people in power - with some power - use their power to impact coroporations and change our culture? That is the target audience for this project. Systemic changes are much more powerful than any individual action.</p>
      <p> In particular I was thinking about my classmates at Olin and where we will be in a number of years. The title of this Biology course is "What Engineers need to Know and Why". I want my project to embody that as best as possible, and give a clear example of why them as an engineer needs to know and care about biology. I want my classmates and myself to think of how we can use our relative positions of power as engineers to push internally for an environment first approach. Or at least not an environment last approach.</p>
