      <h1> Project Overview</h1>
      <p> This website is a compilation of my research of the environmental impact of shipping as a result of consumerism. I looked in three key areas: long transport shipping, last mile delivery, and consumerist culture impacts - mainly Amazon.</p>
      <p>My goal is to shed light on the effects on consumerist culture on the environmenty. I want to encourage people to analyze the culture we exist in and the society we are continually building.</p>
      <h2> Topic Explanation </h2>
      <p>My first two pages: <a href="ocean.html">Ocean Transport</a> and <a href="lastMile">Last Mile</a> look at two of the biggest components of shipping. The majority of the world's goods are moved by cargo ships. One of the most environmentally impactful parts of the shipping process is last mile delivery, where there are significantly more questions and options around optimizations. </p>
      <p>In my opinion, optimizing last mile delivery should be a particular area of interest moving forward. Minimizng environmental impact in last mile delivery often co-insided with a cost savings. However, in our current culture, there is a priority around speed and convenience above cost - both monetarily and environmental in this area.</p>
      <p>The final page, <a href=amazon.html> Amazon</a>, was one of the primary sparks for this project. Amazon has changed so many norms around what our society expects in regards to e-commerce and commerce in general. I have only been alive for 20 years, and yet I have witnessed a massive change in attitudes. It is important to reflect on Amazon and the impact corporations and their decisions can have on our culture.

      <h2> Audience </h2>
      <p> While researching this topic and making this website, I kept in mind one key question: how can people in power use their power to impact corporations and change culture? That is the primary target audience for this projects. Systemic changes enacted by people with systemic power often have much more power than individual action from people that are part of the working class. There is often too much pressure put on individuals to enact system change without power, and I did not what to further inforce that with this project.</p>
      <p>In particular, I was thinking about my classmates at Olin. In a few years, we will all hold relative positions of power and privilege - how will we use that? The title of the Biology course is "What Engineers need to Know and Why?". I want my project to embody that as much as possible, and give clear examples of why an engineer needs to know and care about biology.</p>
      <p>I want my classmates to think about how we can use our relative positions of power to push internally for an environmentall approach. Or at least not an environment last approach.</p>
