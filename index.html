      <h1> Who are the PAs? </h1>
      <p> The PAs are a student volunteer group trained to talk with our peers about healthy relationships, consent, identity, orientation, sexual misconduct, and Title IX, but we are happy to talk with you about anything! If you ever want to talk to one of us about something, feel free to contact us directly to set up a meeting. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <h1> How to contact us? </h1>
      <p>For privacy sake, we only have our emails listed publicly. Most PAs are also happy to set up a visit or chat over phone, text, messenger, discord, email, zoom, in person, etc. We strive to accommodate whatever communication method is best for you.</p>
      <p> You can see a list of current PAs <a href="current.html">here</a>.</p>

      <h1> FAQ </h1>
      <div>
        <h3>What things can a PA help me with?</h3>
        <p>A lot! We can at least direct you the right way in many cases. Peer advocates receive training in Title IX, consent, sexual misconduct, relationships, abuse, and general training in developing empathy skills.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Should I go to an R2 or a PA?</h3>
        <p>R2s receive training in many of the same areas as PAs. However, PAs serve a more targeted role in their speciality areas, while R2s are more of generalists (and are the go to people for residential problems).</p>
        <p>In other words, you could go to an R2 or a PA (or you could go to both) for the areas PAs specialize in. But as PAs, we really strive to excel in our areas because we don't have to worry about R2s other tasks (planning events, enforcing rules in the dorms, dealing with regular residential problems, reporting to STAR, etc). We are also not under any special obligation to Olin administration since we are not employees of the school.</p>
        <p>In the past, one of the big differences was that R2s were mandatory reporters while PAs were not (PAs are not employees of the school). However, with the new Olin Title IX policy, this is no longer the case and no student employees are mandatory reporters - including R2s.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Are PAs confidential resources?</h3>
        <p>Confidential, is a ~ tricky ~ legalise term. So we would say we are a private resource. We are NOT mandatory reporters, meaning we don't have to report anything to the school or administrators.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What is a mandatory reporter?</h3>
        <p>According to Olin's Title IX policy as of 9/5/2020:</p>
        <p>"The College officials listed above must disclose all information they know related to a report of potential sexual harassment, including the names of the alleged victim and perpetrator (if known), any witnesses and any other relevant facts including, the date, time and specific location of the alleged incident.</p>
        <p>To the extent possible, information reported to the above listed College officials will be shared only with the  Title  IX  Coordinator  and  those  who  assist  in  the  implementation  of  Olin’s  Title IX Policy  and procedures. If the incident is an emergency or poses a serious or continuing threat, the official should first call Babson/Olin Public Safety immediately. If the incident is not an emergency does not pose a serious or continuing  threat  the  official  should  not  share  information  with  law  enforcement  without  the  alleged  victim’s consent or unless the employee is otherwise required by law to do so.</p>
        <p>Once the College official learns about an incident, allegation or receives a report, Olin is on actual notice of the alleged incident and the Title IX Coordinator will then take the steps to provide the complainant (if known) with rights and resource information and implement any supportive measures.</p>
        <p>Whenever  possible,  the  above  listed  College  officials  will  disclose  their  duty  to  report  incidents  before  someone  reveals  information  about  an  incident.  Olin  encourages  individuals  to  speak  with  the  Title  IX  Coordinator or one of the officials listed above so that supportive measures may be provided and, if the complainant elects to file a formal complaint, that the incident can be looked into and properly resolved."</p>
        <p>You can see a list of Olin's mandatory reporters in the appendix of the <a href="https://www.olin.edu/sites/default/files/updated_title_ix_policy_-_published.pdf">Olin Title IX Policy and Procedure</a>. Below the list of names you can also see the current mandatory reporter definition as used by Olin.
