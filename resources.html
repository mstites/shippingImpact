        <h3>Changing Olin name/email</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.olin.edu/about/presidents-cabinet/rae-anne-butera-ms/">Rae-Anne</a> approves name and email changes. You can also reach out to <a href="http://www.olin.edu/academic-life/student-affairs-resources/about-us/adva-waranyuwat/">Adva</a> for information. It is a relatively simple one page form to get a name and email change, though there have been issues with people not following through - so make sure to follow up to make sure everyone does their job in getting your info changed.</p>
        <h3>Changing directory photo, pronouns, and/or name</h3>
        <p> Contact Miriam Stulin (Marketing and Communications Specialist) with the updated information. In the past, Rae-Anne and Seth of STAR could also be contacted, but contacting Miriam Stulin directly seems to be the quickest way to get information updated.</p>
