      <h1> Ocean Transport </h1>
      <p>CO2 emissions are significantly lower for maritime transport modes per tonne than for land or air based travels, and therefore shipping is often considered to be a relatively clean transport mode (Jägerbrand 2019). However, cargo ships are by far one of the biggest components of the modern shipping process, accounting for 70% of the total value of international trade (Jägerbrand 2019). This is epecially true in the context of modern demands for the fast and efficient movement of goods (Han 2010). Speed is not cargo ships strong suite, and prioritizing speed comes at the cost of efficiency and impacts.</p>
      <p>Due to the large loads that cargo ships carry, small optimizations on a relatively small fleet size can make a huge difference. Thus, many researchers feel optimizing maritime trade is a great way to reduce emissions with relatively efficent engineering efforts. Below are three key areas of maritime shipping impact: water discharges, physical impacts, and air emissions.</p>
      <div>
        <h2> Water Discharges </h2>
        <div>
          <h3> Statistics and Status</h3>
          <p>Water discharges encompaseses spill and operational discharges of oil and cargo, wastewater, marine liter, nonindigenous species, and antifouling paints.</p>
          <p>Likely due to stricter regulations, the number and volume of large spills from tankers since the 1980s has decreased (Jägerbrand 2019). However, there are doubts around this data as there are increasing dumps of "other substances", which often include discharges of oil.</p>
          <p>Operational discharges (eg release of bilge water, lubrication of propeller shaft bearings,illegal cleaning of tanks) have remained quite high and have likely increased - contributing over 70% of total shipping related oil discharge (Jägerbrand 2019). Outside of oil and related substances, 78,500 tons of potentially hazardous dry bulk cargo enter the marine environment by operational discharges annually (Jägerbrand 2019)</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3> Impact </h3>
          <p> All of these substance impacts have the ability to change the community composition and be toxic o the environment and ecosystems they invade. In particular, ingestion or inhalation of petroleum components can affect digestive, respiratory, and circulatory systems of marine life (Jägerbrand 2019). These impacts can be immediately toxic and kill or can have life long impacts.</p>
          <p>Certain environments and life are particuarly vulnerable. Costal wetlands are vulnerabl due to their low-oxygen environments with slow decomposition (Jägerbrand 2019). This is especially concerning as 80% of the fleets are harbored or near the coast, thus most emissions occur near the coast (Han 2010). Certain species such as sea birds, sea otters, seals, and fish have particular susceptibilities to operational discharges. These toxic discharges can be directly toxic, destroy natural lipids - weakening their natural defenses, cause swelling, decrease filtering capacity, induce liver damage, reduce growth, etc. (Jägerbrand 2019). </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2> Physical Impacts </h2>
          <p> Physical impacts from maritime transportation includes noise, artificial light, wildlife collisions, shoreline erosion and resuspension of sediments, and grounding. </p>
          <div>
            <h3>Noise</h3>
            <p> Cargo ships have a variety of mechanical systems that release noises anywhere between 10 Hz and 1 kHz. These noises can interfere with the natural soundscape. Because the range of frequencies is so wide, they are likely to overlap with the frequencies recognized by a wide array of organisms; this results in interference with navigation, communication, mating, habitat selection, predator avoidance, and the detection of prey (Jägerbrand 2019).</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Artifical Light</h3>
            <p> Light sources above the water can cast into the water. These can interefere with creatures who use light for guidance or signaling. For example, seabirds are attracted to the light and can become disoriented while navigated. Sea turtle hatchlings can be adversly affected by the light productions (Jägerbrand 2019).</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Wildlife Collisions</h3>
            <p>Ships can physically run into marine life while travelling, large whales are particuarly vulnerable.</p>
            <p>Speed is the biggest determiner of the probability of a collison taking place as well as the severity of the impact (Jägerbrand 2019). This is a challenge as shipping speed can need to be increased to match modern fast shipping demands. However, other factors can increase risks such as forces such as ship design. The propeller suction effect can draw creatures, often whales, towards the hull. Certain ship designs are also hard for animals to detect and avoid (Jägerbrand 2019).</p>
            <p>To reduce chances of impact, shipping speed should be delayed, a traffice seperation scheme should be implemented during wintering season. This reduces time in area with a high risk of humpback whale collions, reducing impacts by 95% (Jägerbrand 2019).</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Shoreline Erosion</h3>
            <p>Ships, especially when travelling near the shore, increase the wave energy. This damages oyster reefs, benthic invertebrates, fish, and birds nesting in the shoreline area (Jägerbrand 2019). These increased wave energy causes the shoreline's fine sediments to be transported to deeper waters, effecting the bottom habitats of both environments (Jägerbrand 2019). Reducing speed can help to minimize these effects (Han 2010).</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Ship Grounding and Sinking</h3>
            <p> Over 8600 large shipwrecks lie on the sea floor, predominantly in shallow areas. Ship's are full of hazardeous chemicals that will leak int the environment (Jägerbrand 2019). However, with proper preperation and planning, shipwrecks can be used to create artificial reefs that may improve the local ecosystem and protect from erosion (Jägerbrand 2019). A poorly designed reef, on the other hand, may hinder surrounding natural reefs.</p>

      <h1> Last Mile Delivery </h1>
      <div>
        <h2> Impacts </h2>
        <p>Some stats</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2> Methods </h2>
        There are a number of methods for handling the most complicated stage of the shipping process, last mile delivery. Each of them have their own pros and cons, but often customer convenience and second delievery attempt methods are valued over more economocial and less environmentally impactful options. Choosing the right approach is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, factor in reducing the environmental impact and carbon footprint of shipping. Small trucks, vans, or cars with few packages are significantly less carbon efficient than big trucks (or especially trains) with many packages.ALL BASED FROM SOURCE #1.
        <div>
          <p class=bold>PLAN TO ADD CHART OF THE METHODS AND THEIR ATTRIBUTES</p>
          <h3>Attended Home Delivery</h3>
          <p>Delivery to the home with a costumer signature. This method leads to lots of failed delivery, the source of most green house gas emissions involved in last-mile delivery. This can be minimized by scheduling ahead, but this makes shipping routing complicated and often inefficient.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Unattended Home Delivery</h3>
          <p> Delivery to the home irregardless of signature. Much more efficient than attended home delivery due to the lack of delivery windows but still requires going to home. The high risk of stolen packages leads not only to frustrated customres and lost revanue, but also an environmental impact as those lost packages have to be replaced - essentially doubling the environmental impact of the product, packaging, shipping, etc. Returns are also a big draw back here, as with any residential address drop off, as routes often have to be diverted - out of the way - to pick up returns </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Reception Box</h3>
          <p> A box to drop off packages where the customer can pick up the package when they are available. There are two variants: </p>
          <h4>Own Reception Box</h4>
          <p>The box is at the customer's location. This requires inefficient delivery with lots of stops, but avoids issues of needing to make a second delivery attempt - as the package can be left regardless if a person is home or not.</p>
          <h4>Delivery Box</h4>
          <p>An insulated and secured box to deliver to at some specified location.The location can be chosen using different methods but is usually chosen to optimize some of the inefficiency issues of the own reception box method while still remaining relatively close to the customer. However, because it may not be at a protected residential or commercial address, there is a risk of the box or the items inside being stolen if not secured properly.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Collection Point (CDP)</h3>
          <p>A point where the package recipient can pick up packages. These are more efficient and environmentally conscious than individual reception boxes or home delievery, as the consumer is responsible almost in part for part of that last mile journey - the delivery service only has to get it close not on the door. However, depending on the distribution of people, there can still be a lot of locations required. There are two common variants: locker point and service point.</p>
          <h4>Locker Point</h4>
          <p>A shared reception box installed at a public area. Requires building the point, which can be environmentally and economically costly as there is a lot of security that has to go into a well engineered Locker Point.</p>
          <h4>Service Point</h4>
          <p>Provides the same function as a locker point, but exists in an already existing location such as schools, local stores, hospitals, etc. This significantly reduces the environmental impact compared to locker points, and drastically compared to delivery boxes.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Post Office</h3>
          <p> A post office can be set a set delivery cases. However, they are mostly used now as a destination for failed first-time delivery. Delivering to the post office helps to minimize last mile delivery cost in multiple factors as people can: pay, collect, and most importantly return items. Thus, if a return is needed, it can be sent out from the same location. </p>

    <h1>What can be done? And other commentary</h1>
    <p>The two most common methods currently are both home delivery methods: attended home delivery and unattended home delivery (described above). These also happen to be some of the most impactful methods, especially attended home delivery. When combined with return shipping which can be done from home, this becomes doubly impactful. There has been some recent moves by Amazon to motivate constumers to drop off at a centralized point, such as the USPS or an Amazon Locker, for returns. However, this seems to be more motivated by profits than by environmental impact reasons.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, placing more impact on environmental impact when considering last mile shipping options is a key step in reducing (and reaching net zero) environmental impact. Right now, the culture created by companies and reinstated from consummers values cost savings and convenience above long term impacts to our environment. There are certainly things that can be done as individuals to pressure corporations. But once again, the point of this piece is to encourage those with the power - not individuals as part of the system - to pressure the organizations they are a part of to make ecological impact a part of their key values. Last mile shipping could be a good place to start, as there are also key cost saving benefits that often align with the environmental benefits (reduce number of delivery points, more local delivery, less returns, more efficient routes)</p>
