      <h1> Intro </h1>
      <p> How could we talk about the environmental shipping without bringing up e-commerce giant Amazon? At the time of writing, Amazon accounts for 24% of online retail, peaking at 26% Q1 2020. Not only do they control the single largest segment of the e-commerce segment, but they also set the standard for what consumers expect and what industry will do in the future.</p>
      <p>Discussing Amazon's impact is not only discussing Amazon, but the future of the culture of e-commerce - one of the largest growing segments. Minimizing ecological impact and reaching carbon neutral in this segment needs to be a priority moving forward. But, unfortunately does not seem to be a priority right now in this area.</p>

      <h1> One Free Day Shipping </h1>
      <p>Amazon has historically offered two-day shipping to prime customers in most locations. In April 2019, they announced their plan to move to a free one-day shipping program for all prime customers. At this point, they already have one-day shipping on more than 10 million products in more than 10,000 cities and towns.</p>

      <p>The move to one day shipping furthers the environmental disaster that two day shipping created in comparison with more traditional shipping mechanisms.</p>
      <p>The expectation and normalization of such fast shipping encourages smaller, less consolidated orders. As people know that they can get their items as soon as the next day. Sometimes orders may be placed just minutes apart. Less consolidated packaging means more cars and trucks required to deliver. This creates a number of negative impacts: more packaging waste, congestion in cities, pollutants in the air, and cardboard in the landfills to move the same amount of products. (Hidden Environmental Cost).</p>
      <p>The convenience of fast shipping, especially free shipping encourages people to buy more and more often. Amazon has become an everything shop to constumers, instead of e-commerce just being to suplement what cannot be found in person. According to a study by the UPS, nearly all (96%) of US customers had made a purchase on a marketplace like Amazon or Walmart. 55% said free or discounted shipping was the primary reason.</p>

      <h1> Future of Online Retail </h1>
            MIT Study from link (notion):
      <p>Based on an MIT study, it was determined that online shopping could in theory create a smalle carbon footprint compared to in-person shopping. Online shopping does not require the same overhead in terms of number of retail locations and product distribution. If online retailers chose to optimize their supply chains and packaging, their services could actually hurt the environment less when compared to their brick-and-mortar counterparts.</p>
      <p>This goal becomes more difficult when speed and high demands are taken into question. Both factors which Amazon relies on heavily to market its business to consumers. Currently, standalone companies with contract drivers operate vans that are smaller than freight vehicles to meet speed and high demand. These vehicles have are less efficient than freight vehicles for moving the same amount of goods. Though freight vehicles as they operate today are still responsible for 1/4 of the carbon footprint of the whole transportation category.</p>
      <p>Currently, the emphasis is not put on reducing carbon foot print and environmental impact. So how do we get there? Two steps suggested by the same MIT study earlier were to invest in more zero-emission delivery vehicles and for climates to be more aware of shopping habits. Consumer mindset, greatly informed by corporate practices, has a great effect on environmental impact. Once again, Amazon's fast, free shipping has shifted the mindset of online shipping to be more, more, more.</p>

      <h1> Conclusion </h1>
      <p>Currently there is little focus on environmental issues for big e-commerce sites like Amazon. Although they have goals for the future, the present day practices do not reflect a focus on minimizing impact - but one more purely on maximizing profits.</p>
      <p>It is important to be mindful of how companies such as Amazon can change consumer mindset and purchasing patterns. As engineers, we hold decision making power many people don't have. We can use that power to push for more environmentally friendly values. Currently, theNeed to be mindful of how companies and changes at companies like Amazon change consumer mindsets and patterns. These lead to changes in purchasing patterns which have very real impacts. People are purchasing more, more, more. More often and more things they don't reallym need.</p>
