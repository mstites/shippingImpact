## To Do

* Make methods into a nice flow chart. Venn diagram? Categorization? chart of what is best?

### Design
* Icon
* Favicon
* Cover image
* Make nav bar not sticky

### Questions
* How should we be handling sources? Do they have to be inline citations like in a research paper or can they be a little more fluid?
* Do all resources need to be research paper like?
